. The committee agreed that treatment with antiseizure medication after a first unprovoked seizure should not be offered routinely. However, they agreed that some clinical features should prompt early treatment after a first unprovoked seizure, such as if an examination shows the person has a neurological deficit or the EEG shows unequivocal epileptic activity, which may indicate that the risk of recurrence is high

. The committee agreed not to make a recommendation because any decision to refer for consideration for surgery would be made on an individual basis. Doing research in this area would be difficult because of the limited number of people that have tophi removed.

. However, the committee also stressed that telerehabilitation should only be used if it is the person's preferred option. The relationship between the therapist and the person after stroke should also be maintained, with the option of using in-person therapy instead if needed. As with face-to-face therapy, telerehabilitation should aim to meet the goals the person has agreed with their therapist

Registry evidence has suggested treatments for RP such as CCBs may reduce the likelihood of developing PAH and left ventricular dysfunction in SSc [70]. Several complementary treatments including low-level light therapy, antioxidants, gingko biloba, acupuncture, L-argi  nine and essential fatty acids have been studied, but their im  pact on RP severity has been modest at best [71]
